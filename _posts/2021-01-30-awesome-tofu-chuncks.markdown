Let's be real, tofu on its own is the not most exiting thing. Recently however, we made a recipe where the tofu was really good! Let me share it with you.

The recipe we made was a [Sweet and Sour Tofu Stir Fry](https://www.pickuplimes.com/single-post/sweet-and-sour-tofu-stir-fry). I wasn't a big fan of the recipe itself. Partially because I'm not a big fan of sweet dishes and partially because we might have made it a bit too sour. 

But. The tofu chunks on their own were delicious. It was actually quite a shame that you had to mix them into the sweet and sour sauce which  completely overwhelmed them. If you would use these chunks in a stir fry, or on the side of some Asian style dishes, it would would like a charm.

## Recipe

As per instructions of [Sadia Badiei](https://www.pickuplimes.com/single-post/sweet-and-sour-tofu-stir-fry):

1. To a large shallow bowl, add the:
    - 450 g, 1 cm cubed tofu  
    - 30 ml (2 tbsp) sodium reduced soy sauce

    and gently toss to coat. Then add the:
    - 30 g (1/4 cup) cornstarch, 
    - 1/2 tsp salt, 
    - 1/4 tsp pepper. 

    Gently stir until all the pieces are well coated.  

2. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat, and add in the oil. When hot, add the tofu and cook the tofu for 7 - 10 minutes, or until it's crispy and golden on all sides. Don't disturb the tofu too much while it's cooking, otherwise, it might crumble. Only stir it every couple of minutes.
